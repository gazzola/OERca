### Intro ###
OERca, the Open Educational Resources (OER) clearing application,
is a content and decision management system, designed by the
University of Michigan Open.Michigan team, to assist content
creators in transforming educational material into OER.

OERca is a web-based content clearing application that supports the
[dScribe](http://open.umich.edu/wiki/DScribe) process.
People engaged in the process of creating open content can use OERca
to organize materials, track changes within the resource, manage
rights and license information, and collaborate with others with
whom youâ€™re working to create and clear content. 

See the [wiki page](http://open.umich.edu/wiki/OERca) for more information.
