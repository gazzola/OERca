2/12/2009:

I obtained the current subversion trunk version of
the necessary hachoir components (core, regex, and subfile)
using the following commands:

% svn co http://hachoir.org/svn/trunk/hachoir-core
% svn co http://hachoir.org/svn/trunk/hachoir-regex
% svn co http://hachoir.org/svn/trunk/hachoir-subfile
% svn co http://hachoir.org/svn/trunk/hachoir-parser

(NOTE that the current subversion trunk version does a
better job than the packaged downloads.  That is the
reason the next steps are necessary.)

Remove the existing subversion information so we can check
this code into _our_ subversion.

% find . -type d -name .svn -exec rm -rf {} \;
